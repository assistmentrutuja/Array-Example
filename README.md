# Array-Example
Moved the System.out.print statement inside the inner loop to correctly print each element in the array. Added System.out.println(); after printing each row to move to the next line for better readability. Added sc.close(); to close the Scanner object to prevent resource leak. It's good practice to close the scanner when it's no longer needed.
